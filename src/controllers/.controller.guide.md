## About this folder

This folder contain the controllers for this backend application.

What is controller doing?

- Init swagger API documentation
- Validate request schema by using Joi package
- Parse request to DTO
- 1 controller can call many services for doing specific bussiness job
- Parse the result of the service give back to DTO
- Format the response to BaseResponse

## Usage

This will introduce you how to create new controller

1. First create a new interface:

In controllers/interfaces:

```
export interface IDogController {
  createNewDog(req: Request, res: Response<BaseResponse<CreateNewDogResponseDto>>, next: NextFunction): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Rules:

- Each res need to have type Response<BaseResponse<....>>. What is "BaseResponse" ? This is the class that will be use for formatting the response before give it back to client, by using BaseResponse<T>, the response will be formatted as:

```json
  httpStatus: number;
  httpMessage: string;
  error: ErrorResponseDTO | null;
  data: T;
```

2. Implement the controller for the interface:

See ./dog.controller.ts

### Rules:

- The request.body must be convert to the specific DTO before send it to the services
- The result of services also must be convert to specific DTO
- The response must be formatted to BaseResponse before send back to client
